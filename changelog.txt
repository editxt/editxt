This file contains notable new features and other large changes. See
https://github.com/editxt/editxt for details of what actually happened.

2014-12-30 - 1.7.1
  - Fix a bug that prevented auto-update.

    NOTE: you need to run a command in the terminal before clicking
    **Install and Relaunch** during the update process (adjust the
    `/Applications/EditXT.app` part of the path to where EditXT.app
    is located on your local machine):

    ```
    chmod +x /Applications/EditXT.app/Contents/Frameworks/Sparkle.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/Autoupdate.app/Contents/MacOS/Autoupdate
    ```

    Bug details: https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/issues/309

2014-12-30 - 1.7.0
  - Add customizable *Shortcuts* menu for quick command execution. The items in
    this menu can be customized by adding a `shortcuts` section to the config
    file (EditXT > Preferences). For example:
    ```
    shortcuts:
      Command+C: clear_highlighted_text
      Command+Alt+s: sort
    ```
    Note:
    - Menu is not yet updated with `reload_config` command. Restart for now.
    - The following key combinaations are equivalent:
      `Command+C` and `Command+Shift+c`
    - The *Shortcuts* menu is pre-loaded with shortcuts for document tree
      navigation. These default shortcuts are merged with the custom shortcuts
      specified in the config file.
    - Some shortcuts in other menus cannot be overridden with custom shortcuts.
  - Add "doc" command for document tree navigation. This command can be used
    to focus editors by name, in the order they have been most recently visited
    (`previous` / `next`), or by relative position (`up` / `down`).
  - Rename *Text* menu to *Command*
  - Add command bar help, which is accessed with F1 key or with the
    *Help > Command Help* menu item when the command bar is active.
  - Add button to show command output in panel so it can be preserved while
    other commands that produce output are executed.
  - Fix "ack" command output formatting.
  - Eliminate superfluous trailing backslash in ack command output.
  - Fix "open" command creating duplicate editor.
  - Fix command bar auto-complete bugs.
  - Fix display flash on hide command view.
  - Various other bug fixes.

2014-12-01 - 1.6.0
  - Toggle last command output with Escape key.
  - Add "ack" command integration for code search. Command output contains
    clickable links to open files. Command+click to open files in background.
    Ack (http://beyondgrep.com/) must be installed and the path to the ack
    executable may need to be specified in preferences. For example:
    ```
    command:
      ack:
        path: /usr/local/bin/ack
    ```
  - Add "grab" command to collect lines matching a pattern.
  - Add "open" command (alias "xt") for opening files from command bar.
  - Add support for invoking commands from project view.
  - Add "set project_path ..." command. The project path is used as a fallback
    default path for commands that touch the filesystem if the current editor
    does not have a path.
  - Add Sparkle updater for automatic updates.
  - Improve command bar auto-complete menu so it doesn't display off screen.
  - Improve auto-complete algorithm to use longest common substring rather
    than currently selected item.

    allowing text transformations such as case changes or conditional
    replacements, far beyond what is possible with a regular expression find/
    replace operation. Example replace expression:

      match.group(1).lower() + match.group(2)

  - Dramatic performance boost when highlighting selected text.
  - Add count-occurrences action to find command.
  - Add right_margin config settings:

    EditXT was also used on a daily basis for other software development.
