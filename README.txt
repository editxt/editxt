Known issues:

- sometimes the close (X) buttons in the document pane stop displaying the
  dirty status of the documents. This is VERY ANNOYING, I wish I could find a
  way to reproduce this bug.

- changing the tab width when in tab-indent mode does not automatically update
  the width of tabs. Recommendation: use spaces not tabs for indentation.

- there may be others...

DISCLAIMER: EditXT is always in development and may have bugs that could
cause you to lose your work. However, the primary developer has been using it
for professional software development since 2008 and thinks it is quite
usable, if incomplete. You can download the source code and help with
