Building and packaging

Python environment setup. RECOMMENDED: use a virtualenv
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv). Install dependencies::

    mkvirtualenv --python=python3 ...

    pip install --upgrade pip           # v1.4.1 at time of writing
    pip install --upgrade setuptools    # setuptools-1.1.6, distribute-0.7.3

    # optional: PyYAML with LibYAML inside virtualenv
    mkdir temp && cd temp
    curl http://pyyaml.org/download/libyaml/yaml-0.1.4.tar.gz > yaml-0.1.4.tar.gz
    tar xf yaml-0.1.4.tar.gz
    cd yaml-0.1.4
    CFLAGS=$(python3-config --cflags) ./configure --prefix=$VIRTUAL_ENV --disable-dependency-tracking
    make
    make install
    cd ../.. && rm -rf temp

    pip install --requirement=requires.txt

    # optional (for efficient test runner)
    pip install MacFSEvents

Build development/test bundle (EditXTDev.app, necessary for ./xt script)::

    python setup.py py2app -A

Run tests::

    ./xt --test

    # single test::
    ./xt --test --tests editxt.test.test_document:TestTextDocument.test_get_with_path_1

    # test automation
    ./xt --nosy

    # run EditXT in dev mode
    ./xt

Build/package EditXT.app::

    python setup.py py2app

    # package in a zip file for distribution::
    python setup.py py2app --package

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Top priority

Add ack-like command
Add open file command
Add move command to relocate file on disk
Add py command for quick python command execution
Fix intermittent freeze on startup
Fix window dirty indicator
Add automatic file move detection

Use something like Sparkle to auto-update http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/
open command
    - Open directory as project
File tree as main project view
grep command (for finding/printing lines in file)
Persistent unsaved docs
Embed file type icons in app (also provide support for user icon sets)

Project enhancements
  - show sorter paths in recent files list, and elide middle?
  - project base path
  - allow drag/drop from recent files list
  - add support for drag/drop recent files

Select mutliple documents -> main view is a composite view
  multiple concatenated document views (like skype messages pane with)
  banner at top shows title of document in view (like skype date banner)

Project drag/drop bugs
  - Current editor should be focused in new window when its project is dragged to new window
  - Combine and write pythonic wrapper for outline view and NSTreeController
    -> editxt.platform.mac.views.DocumentTreeView
    - ?? Formalize pythonic KVO observe/callback

Display errors and open config files that cannot be loaded automatically
  - Do not overwrite files on save/close

Command bar enhancements:
    contextual command help
        http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/reference.html#output_format
        NSTextStorage.initWithHTML_documentAttributes_(text, None)
    list history
        tab key should show list of auto complete options and filtered history
    filter history
        up arrow after typing should step through history with same prefix
        all text after manually typed prefix should be selected
    delete history item

Convert commands with gui to work with command bar
    open file(s)
    change indentation

refactor object hierarchy to make it more modular and easier to add features
    app.documents - {id: Document}
    app.windows - [Window]
    ? app.current_window - Window
    app.profile_path

    group.expanded - bool, is group expanded
    group.editors - [Editor]
    group.current_editor - Editor
    group.history - [...] recently closed editors

    syntax.name
    syntax.path
    syntax.indent_style
    syntax.indent_width
    syntax.newline_style
    ? syntax.wordsets
    ...

work on projects
    add "undo close document" for project
        project will need a concept of recent documents
    implement close document (COMMAND+W)
save untitled and unsaved documents in a temporary location
    allow naming unsaved documents like naming projects
    save undo stack?
save settings in ~/.editxt/config
find/replace text processors

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bugs

Bug: drag/drop results in errors
  focus document
  drag same document from one window to another
  drag same document back to original window
  try to edit text in other window (errors in console)

Bug in Version 1.4.0-pre (20131130.68db8d4)
  - drag a project with at least one document from window1 to window2
  - move (on the filesystem) a document (that is not in focus) of the project
  - focus the document (notice path has changed to where it was moved)
  - make a change, save
  - notice sheet pops up on window1
  - sheet should be on window2
Similar to above Bug in Version 1.4.0-pre (20131130.68db8d4)
  - command bar for documents whose project was dragged new new window
    appears in the (original) wrong window on press COMMAND+;

Bug: memory leak
    TODO track it down and fix it

Bug: save file that has had changes discarded with GitX while open in EditXT
    Should not prompt for save location
    Possibly should show confirm overwrite sheet

Bug: selected document out of sync with active document on drag-n-drop
    (reported by Joel on Oct 15, 2010)
    * open a new project
    * open two additional new documents (the document panel on the left should
      now look as follows)
        untitled project
            Untitled
            Untitled 2
            Untitled 3
    * type something unique in each of the three untitled documents
      (for identifying the active document later)
    * select (activate) the first document "Untitled"
    * drag and drop "Untitled" below "Untitled 3"
    BUG: observe; "Untitled" is still the active document, but "Untitled 3" is
    now the selected document in the left pane.
    EXPECTED: "Untitled" should still be the selected document.

    Final note: There are some other drag-and-drop actions that cause this
    behavior, I haven't been able to identify them all.

Bug: closing duplicate dirty file (reported by Joel on Jul 20, 2010)
    * Open EditXT
    * Open a file
    * Make a change to the file
    * If only one project is available, create a new one
    * In the document browser, drag the above-mentioned dirty file into a different project
    * Observe; the dirty file now exists in both projects (expected)
    * Close one of the two (duplicate) files

    BUG: Observe; the user is prompted to save the file.
    EXPECTED: The document should "close" (or rather, simply be removed from
    that project) silently because it still exists in another project.
    
    On second thought... I don't know what the best result here WOULD be.  Say
    the user has LOTS of projects/documents open, some of the documents are
    open in multiple projects (for whatever reason); if (s)he closes a dirty
    file (not remembering that it exists in other project(s)), maybe it is best
    to get the save dialog.  I don't know, what do you think?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TODO

Projects:
    Most important new features to implement:
        Allow project to be open in more than one window at once
        Enhanced recent documents list
        Remember editor settings per document
        Save project to file (.edxt)
        Add subclass of NSDocument to represent project document

    project.Project - plain python object, manages list of DocInfo objects
    project.ProjectView - what used to be project.Project
    document.DocInfo - plain python object, manages document info

put the selected text at the top of the recent finds menu (in Find/Replace)
put text processors in the recent replaces menu

x need some way to view/change settings
x    option 1 - put menu in the status bar (like TextWrangler)
x    option 2 - implement document properties view below document selector
x implement line endings
x    python -c 'print repr(open("Desktop/newline.txt").read())'
x implement space-filled tabs
x    intent with correct character(s) on keypress (tab/shift tab) or auto-indent
x    prompt to convert file on mode change
x    delete multiple spaces when deleting backward in space-indent mode
x    detect indent mode in file when opened (fallback to indent mode specified in syntax definition)
xx    skip spaces when moving with arrow keys when in space-indent mode
    convert pasted text
implement syntax definitions
x implement file encodings
x implement word wrap
x    bug: set view to word-wrap mode, switch to a different document, switch back (no vertical scroll bar)
x        precondition: the document should not have a vertical scrollbar when NOT in word wrap mode
x        precondition: it should have a vertical scrollbar when in word wrap mode
    bug: while scrolled down in a document enable word wrap -> scrolls to top

bug: open editor with two windows saved in prefs
    (each window having two document views of the same documents,
        with the same document selected in each window)
    view document other than the document that opens by default
    focus second window, view document

x things to put in the document attributes panel:
x    word wrap
x    line ending style
x    spaces instead of tabs
x    tab width
x    character encoding
xx    font - this could remain in the context menu
x    syntax highlighting type

SERIOUS Bug: sometimes documents do not track dirty status
    one time this occurred after editing a file on a network share
    although it has happened at other times when no shared docs were being edited
Bug: when editing large files sometimes the line below the edited line disappears
Bug: file encoding should be explicitly set on save
Bug: document shifts to the left when lines are longer than window width
Bug: cannot open project in two windows at same time (views are shared, but should not be)
Bug: window controller hides next window controller on close with dirty documents (while editing clean doc)

Improve LineNumberView implementation
    Fix drawing of line numbers > 99
    Implement word-wrap line numbering

Project persistence
x     When a project with no path is saved it will be saved in the user
x     preferences. As long as the project is open in the editor and has no path it
x     will remain in the user preferences. When the project is manually closed or
x     when the editor is closed and the project has only unsaved documents it will
x     be removed from the user preferences.

    A project may be saved to disk, at which point it gains a path
    (project.path is not None). If project path is not None but the file does
    not exist (e.g. if the file was deleted) then the project will be saved in
    the user preferences and its path will be discarded.
    
Add a recent documents view as the project main view
    Should allow opening documents that have been closed
    Should allow commands (diff, etc) between documents

Fix selection changing behavior in documents view:
x    On startup select current text document
x    On select document display document's TextView in editor window
xx    On select project revert selection to previously selected document
    On collapse project with active document
        activate most recently active document among visible documents
        clear text area if no documents are visible
    On select collapsed project expand project and select most recently selected document

Fix bugs in splitview:
    combine MailStyle...View and SliderImageView into a single view - 
        Draw the left, center, and right sides of the view independently
        MailStyle...View covers SliderImageView when resizing the splitview too
        small (to the left) (min fixed width ThinSplitView must be about 60)
    fix bug: SliderImageView cannot collapse/uncollapse its splitview

Improvement ideas

Add better support for TextCommands
    make it simple to create/edit text commands
    put a save hook on the command source file when editing it so that the editor
        reloads the command(s) in that file when the file is saved

Improve projects:
    record all open projects on File->Quit
    allow a new project to be created without first choosing a location where it will be saved
    allow multiple projects per window (use project name as divider between document "groups")
    allow document to be opened in new window (and/or dragged to a different window)

Documents list
    fix drag/move documents - use path instead of index range
    add context menu
    allow text commands to be added to documents list text menu
        svn diff
        diff with...

Improve text view
    syntax highlighting for multiple document types
x    status area in lower-left (beside bottom scrollbar)
x        current row/column/selection length
        line-ending style
x    text view state elements (stored in project file):
x        scroll position
x        selection range
        font setting?
        word wrap state?
        line number ruler state?

Preferences system
    font
    tab width (custom per syntax definition type and open document)
    etc.

Add "Search all documents" feature to find/replace dialog
Make find-count status area into a sliding view in the find/replace text field

Improve TextCommands
    hotkey handling
    add more commands
        hard-wrap
        sort lines
        change case (and variants)
    allow text commands to be added to the context menu

Better syntax highlighting
    make it faster when transitioning to/from a delimited range near the beginning of a large document
        http://www.stiefels.net/2008/01/22/syntax-highlighting-for-nstextview-with-flex/
    more lanugages
    better language detection (file extension, shebang line, etc.)

Add split view feature (split documents list as well)

Add untitled document to default project on startup.
    Give default project a name other than "Untitled" on startup so the first
        document gets some other name
    Alternate: create a new project and use it to open a document if no projects are open

x Implement project/document relationship.

startup controllflow:
x     startup (no document)
x         if default project does not exist:    
x             write new default project to disk
x         proj = ProjectDocument(defaultProjectPath)
x         proj.newTextDocument()
    startup with text document path
        if default project does not exist:
            write new default project to disk
        proj = ProjectDocument(defaultProjectPath)
        proj.openTextDocument(path)
    startup with project
        proj = ProjectDocument(projectPath)

Syntax coloring design - use pygments library

xx syntax elements
xx     valid identifier characters
xx     keyword / character string without spaces
xx     range delimiters
xx         start delim
xx         end delim
xx xx        multi-line: yes/no
xx xx        type: solid color, embedded highlighting
xx 
xx When balancing delimiters such as parens, brackets, etc. scan backward or
xx     forward (depending on type of bracket) from the current character to the
xx     end of the characters visible on the screen.

EditXT Design

Slogan: EditXT - the editor that remembers where you were

Profile structure:
    .editxt
        cache
            document-N
                ...
        editors
            editor-N.yaml
        ext
        syntax
        config.yaml

Discussion of documents in EditXT

There are two kinds of documents in EditXT: text documents and projects. Text
documents will respond to the complete set of document actions such as New,
Open, Save, Close, etc. Projects only respond to a subset of these actions;
namely New Project, Open Project and Close Project. Projects do not need an
undo manager. 

When a document is opened it may be one of two things: ProjectDocument or TextDocument
    If it is a ProjectDocument then a new project window should be loaded.
    If it is a TextDocument then it should be opened in the current project.
    A new project should be opened if there is no current project.
        This probably needs to happen at the DocumentController level.
    
NSDocumentController (canned ObjC class, not extended)
    maintains a list of the documents that are currently open
    options for the "Window" menu:
xx        list all documents in a hierarchical structure (project has submenu of documents)
xx        list all documents (not projects)
        list current document of each project window

NSWindowController
    Tasks overview:
        Loading and displaying the window
        Closing the window when appropriate
        Customizing the window's title
        Storing the window's frame (size and location) in the defaults database
        Cascading the window in relation to other document windows of the application
    Note that all of these tasks are specific to a ProjectDocument. It would
    follow that a TextDocument only needs a stub of a window controller, and
    that is only necessary if/because NSDocument must have a window controller
    (verify this).
    
    Find out how NSDocument is connected to controls (widgets) and how dirty
    detection happens (through undo manager). The connection is probably this:
        NSDocument -> UndoManager -> widget
    there may be some things in between those elements, what are they?

Options for ProjectDocument (PD) and TextDocument (TD)
    See this first: http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?DocumentBasedAppWithOneWindowForAllDocuments
    PD inherits NSDocument
      pros
        it loads and saves data to a file (but only programatically)
        it is has a window
        it can take advantage of NSWindowController
        it should appear in the top level of the Window menu
      cons
        a project is never explicitly saved (it is saved when a document is saved)
    TD inherits NSDocument
      pros
        it loads and saves data to a file
        it needs an undo manager
      cons
        it does not have its own window
        it cannot take advantage of NSWindowController
        it should not appear in the top level of the Window menu

ProjectDocument
    menu actions:
        new project (maybe prompt to create new proj. with all open documents?)
        open project
        close project
    is represented by a file
    contains multiple documents
    does not need undo/redo capability
    can be opened/closed (saved?? must happen without user interaction)
        the only time a project will ever be saved is when the user modifies and
        saves at least one text document

TextDocument
    is represented by a file
    can be opened, closed, saved, reverted, etc. (all the normal file operations)
    Attributes:
        name
        path
        icon
        syntax_def
        length (number of lines)
        width (number of characters, lazily calculated based on lines that have been seen)
        current_line

The WindowController for TextDocument will NOT manage an actual window. Instead
    it will manage an entry in the document list as well as the text view (contents?)
    for its document, as well as any other resources associated with the document.

problem: the inherited NSDocument implementation of ProjectDocument thinks
    the ProjectDocument is dirty if the contents of the textview have been
    changed since the main text view is part of the project window.
side affects
    project window prompts for save (as name of project) on close (we do not want this)
    TextDocument does not know it is dirty
implications:
    ProjectDocument needs to override parts of NSDocument that cause the save prompt.
    TextDocument needs to prompt for save if it is dirty when its project is closed.

Q. What is the biggest text file that this editor must easily handle without
excessive delays in loading, searching, etc.?
A. As large as can be comfortably navigated with the scrollbar on the side of
the main text view.
